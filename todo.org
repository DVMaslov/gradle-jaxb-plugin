* DONE is it reasonable to add anything for external include statements??
  CLOSED: [2013-01-22 Tue 15:24]
** Can't check for namespace, becuase includes doesn't use that, but could check the startingDir

* DONE jaxbSchemaDestinationDirectory is defaulted to
  jaxbSchemaDestinationDirectory = "src/main/java"
  in Plugin configruation. it should be something more like 
  "${project.dir}/src/main/java" 
  because currently you can only run it from it's subproject dir, not the top level.
